kahua-spvr
kahua-spvr [-c conf-file] [-i] [-l logfile] [-H [host:]port] 

Starts the supervisor process. As the need arises, the Kahua supervisor process runs the worker process along the lines of the key server process (kahua-keyserv), HTTPd process (kahua-httpd) as well as app-servers file. Additionaly, it dispatches request from client to the worker and monitors its process's alive.

Activation options

 -c conf-file
Set the configuration file name to refer. $(sysconfdir)/kahua/kahua.conf is default configuration file. If you didn't set configure script, /usr/local/etc/kahua/kahua.conf is default configuration file.

The configuration file name given here carries on into kahua-keyserv and kahua-server. See the kahua.config to know the document format and configuration format.

 -i 
Start repl(read-eval-print-loop) to normal input and output by this interactive option. This is for debug use.

 -l log-file

Set the log file. Output logs to the stdout as "-l -".
 $(working-directory)/logs/kahua-spvr.log is selected by default.

 -H, --httpd [host:]port

Start the kahua-httpd with setting the option value as argument
Set like following examples.
  -H 8080
  -H localhost:8080
See the kahua-httpd in detail.

The active kahua-spvr is able to be controlled interactively by kahua-admin command. In the present status, kahua-spvr can not be activated by daemonizing itself or by changing to certain authority.

Try bellowing command to activate kahua-spvr at the background.

 % (kahua-spvr >> /logpath 2>&1 &)

Also, try following command to active kahua-spvr with downgrading authority from root to certain user.

 # su kahua -c "(kahua-spvr >> /logpath 2>&1 &)"

The normal output and normal error output of kahua-spvr should not redirect to /dev/null because the error message of abnormal exit appears in normal error output.

app-servers file

kahua-spvr load the file,$(working-directory)/app-servers file, to get information of which worker should be managed.

This file is usually loaded on start-up. Also, you can reload with reload command from kahua-admin.


Followings are forms of app-servers.

 ((<server-type> :arguments <args> :run-by-default <count>
   [:profile <base-path>] [:default-database-name <dbname>])
  ...)

 <server-type>

<server-type> is symbol. You can write type of worker, application name with this.

 <args>

.<args> is the list of arguments. Write only () to set nothing.

 :run-by-default <count>

Set the number of process on kahua-spvr start-up.
kahua-spvr dispatches the requests from clients to these processes by rotation.

 :profile <base-path>

Set the base name of output file, in case of using gauche profiler.
For example, in case of setting as '/usr/local/kahua/logs/profile', the file name will be '/usr/local/kahua/logs/profile.<worker-id>' and result of profile will be output every time certain worker processes 100 requests.

 :default-database-name <dbname>

Set the database name which is used by application by default.
In case of skip, the file system database will be created at ${working-directory}/db.


These setting are ignored, if there are any errors in app-servers file.
If you see kahua-spvr logs and find error, try to reload with reload command from kahua-admin after modifying app-servers file.
