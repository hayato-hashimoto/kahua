;; For clients, this server works as a receptionist of kahua system.
;; It opens a socket where initial clients will connect.
;; This server doesn't know about internals of kahua server, but
;; just dispatches it to the worker servers.
;; Eventually, this server will manage multiple worker servers for
;; load balancing or hot restarting.
;; For now, we have only one worker server, so this is just an outline
;; of what we will ultimately do.

;; Supervisor protocol
;;
;; [Session initiation]
;;
;;  A client first connect to a well known socket of the supervisor.
;;  This first request is called session-initiaing request.
;;  At this point, a client wouldn't have complete GSID.  It may have
;;  state ID from the last session, but it certainly doesn't have
;;  continuation ID.
;;
;;  When the supervisor observes it, and the request is not for direct
;;  administrative request for the supervisor itself, it assigns a
;;  worker and forwards the session-initiating request to the worker.
;;  The worker will return a reply, usually accompanied by GSID.
;;  The supervisor forwards the reply to the client.
;;
;;  Afterwards, the client can figure out the worker ID encoded in GSID,
;;  and directly connects to the worker.
;;
;;  Client can optionally pass the worker type it wants to talk to,
;;  using "x-kahua-worker" header.   If such header is absent, the
;;  supervisor selects the default worker.
;;
;;  As a special case, "spvr" is given to "x-kahua-worker", the body
;;  is interpreted by the spvr process as a command.  See "supervisor
;;  commands" below.
;;
;; [Message format]
;;
;;  Request and reply both consist of two S-expressions, a header and
;;  a body.  A header is a list of two-element lists, resembles to
;;  what rfc822-header->list returns.   A body can be any valid sexpr.
;;  It is arguable whether this format is adequate or not.  Let's see.
;;
;;  In a request header, "x-kahua-sgsid" elemnt carries state GSID,
;;  and "x-kahua-cgsid" carries continuation GSID.  Other header can
;;  be freely used by the worker.  A client may send additional information
;;  in the header, and the worker should ignore the header element that
;;  it doesn't understand.
;;
;;  In a reply header, "x-kahua-sgsid" and "x-kahua-cgsid" are also
;;  used to carry GSID.  It also contains "x-kahua-status", whose value
;;  is either "OK", "ERROR", or "SPVR-ERROR".   "ERROR" indicates
;;  an error occurred in the worker, and "SPVR-ERROR" indicates an
;;  error occurred in the supervisor.  The message body of error replies
;;  contains a list of a error message string (for now).
