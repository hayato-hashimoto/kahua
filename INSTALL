* Setup Kahua

** Preparation

*** Installing Gauche

To use Kahua, you need Gauche 0.8.7 or later that supports pthread.
Until release of Gauche 0.8.8, CVS HEAD version is recomended
because some critical bugs was fixed.
{{{
$ gosh -V
Gauche scheme interpreter, version 0.8.7 [utf-8,pthreads]
}}}

If you have not installed proper version of Gauche, please install new
version.

----
** Let's just try Kahua

*** Building tarball

If you just simply try Kahua, installing under HOME directroy is
recommended.  The reason is that you don't need to care about
permissions and user/group settings.

{{{
% tar xvzf Kahua-0.7.tgz
% cd Kahua-0.7
% ./configure --prefix=$HOME/kahua --with-staticdir=$HOME/public_html/kahua
% make
% make check
% make install
% make install-examples
}}}

This will build from the source code and install it under the
${HOME}/kahua and $HOME/public_html/kahua directory.  It will help you
to add ${HOME}/kahua/bin directory to your PATH.

*** Start Kahua

After having installed, you can easily try by running the standalone server: 

% ($HOME/kahua/bin/kahua-spvr --httpd localhost:8888 >>/tmp/kahua-error.log &)

You can set any port number except privileged port.
If you appoint only port number, you can bind server socket to 0.0.0.0(or[::]).

Then, start a browser and visit http://localhost:8888/.
You will see and use  one of sample application,"lambdabooks".


----

** Proper Installation procedure

If you'd like to install Kahua as root into system area,
you should know about Kahua a little more, and need
several steps.

*** Users and Processes in Kahua

In Kahua system, there are 3 categories processes,
they run under different user privilege and communicate with
each other.

# Kahua Servers(Process: kahua-spvr, kahua-server, kahua-keyserv)
# Kahua Bridges(Process: kahua.cgi, kahua.fcg, kahua-httpd)
# Kahua Administrator and Application Developer
  (Real users use kahua-admin and kahua-user)

All of them must be able to read and write the same UNIX domain
socket.  And Kahua Servers and Kahua Bridges must be able to
read and write temporary files under the same directory.

*** Create group "kahua"

You should create a new group, and add all above users to it,
so that all Kahua processes communicate with each other via
the same UNIX domain socket.
{{{
# groupadd kahua
}}}

Some operating system have some different command to do the
same task.  Please see your system manuals.

*** Create user "kahua"

You should run Kahua Servers(kahua-spvr and scripts invoked by it)
under a UNIX user privilege only for them.  Now we assume the user
is "kahua".
{{{
# useradd -g kahua kahua
}}}

*** Add other users to group "kahua"

Now you should add the user under which Kahua Bridges run and
Kahua administorators and application developers (they are real users)
to group "kahua" created above.

Kahua Bridge CGI scripts (kahua.cgi/kahua.fcg) are generally
invoked by Web server(like Apache httpd or lighttpd).  We assume that
the Web server runs as user "www" (and you don't use suEXEC).
{{{
# usermod -G kahua www
}}}
You may restart the Web server to reflect this change.

Kahua administrators and application developers should be added
to group "kahua" in the same way.
{{{
# usermod -G kahua taro
# usermod -G kahua hanako
}}}
and so on.

*** Configuration and building

Kahua is made up of almost pure Scheme(Gauche) scripts and rare shell
scripts, but you should do configuration carefully.

This is configuration and building process on a real site.
{{{
% tar xzvf Kahua-0.7.tgz
% cd Kahua-0.7
% ./configure \
    --with-kahua-user=kahua --with-kahua-group=kahua --with-cgi-user=www \
    --prefix=/usr/local/kahua \
    --sysconfdir=/usr/local/etc \
    --localstatedir=/var/local \
    --with-cgidir=/var/local/www/cgi-bin \
    --with-cgilogdir=/var/log/kahua/cgi \
    --with-staticdir=/var/local/www/htdocs/kahua-data \
    --with-fastcgi=yes
% make
}}}
You can use GNU make or BSD make.  If you fail with BSD make, Please
try GNU make and report us what is wrong with BSD make.

**** configure options

Please see message of
{{{
% ./configure --help
}}}
but we describe some important options.
{{{
 --with-kahua-user

     User name under which Kahua Servers run.  Default: not specified.

 --with-kahua-group

     Group name that all users related to Kahua System must belong to.
     Default: not specified.

 --with-cgi-user

     User name under which Kahua Bridge CGI scripts(kahua.cgi/kahua.fcg)
     run. Generally it is the same user under which the Web server run.
     Default: not specified.

 --with-cgidir

     Directory path where Kahua Bridge CGI scripts are installed.
     It depend on your Web server configuration.
     Default: ${libexecdir}/kahua

 --with-cgilogdir

     Directory path where Kahua Bridge CGI scripts write log
     files out.  Default: ${localstatedir}/kahua/cgilog

 --prefix, --exec-prefix, ...

     Configure standard options.  Generally you'd like to set --prefix,
     --localstatedir, --sysconfdir and so on.  Kahua applications,
     Kahua databases, log directories are normally deployed under
     ${localstatedir}/kahua, and the configuration file is
     ${sysconfdir}/etc/kahua.conf.

 --with-staticdir

     Kahua Servers and kahua-httpd search static contents(image files,
     CSS files, etc...) under this directory. Default: /var/www/kahua

 --with-fastcgi

     Install kahua.fcg, a Kahua Bridge FastCGI script.  You must
     install Gauche-fastcgi extension in advance.  Default: no
}}}

*** Self check

Just do this:
{{{
% make check
}}}

*** Installation

You execute this command as root.
{{{
% su
# make install
}}}

If you'd like to install sample applications,
you should execute this command as a Kahua developer(not root).
{{{
% make install-examples
}}}
And you must fix owner/group of the sample database like this:
{{{
% su
# chown -R kahua:kahua /usr/local/kahua/var/kahua/db*
}}}
You need * tail of above command line.  Don't forget it.

*** Start Kahua Servers

Congratulations!  Now you can start Kahua Servers.
Kahua Servers should be invoked under "kahua" user privilege.
{{{
# su kahua -c ${prefix}/bin/kahua-spvr
}}}
This command invoke kahua-spvr, Kahua Supervisor command, and
it invoke kahua workers(kahua-server) and a key server(kahua-keyserv).
If you want to use it with Kahua Web Server(kahua-httpd), you
just do this:
{{{
# su kahua -c ${prefix}/bin/kahua-spvr --httpd localhost:8888
}}}
If you want that Kahua Servers run as background processes,
you just do like this:
{{{
# su kahua -c "(${prefix}/bin/kahua-spvr >>${localstatedir}/kahua/logs/kahua-error.log 2>&1 &)"
}}}

Kahua System doesn't yet have any mechanism that register their startup
scripts to operating system.  You must create them by hand, or you can
use "daemontools" to manage Kahua Servers processes.
