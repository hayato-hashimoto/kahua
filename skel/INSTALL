%%_PROJECT_NAME_%% : A simple dummy application of Kahua

[Requirements]

Gauche-0.8.7
Kahua-0.4.1

[Installation]

  % autoconf
  % ./configure [any options if you need]

You have to give some options to specify the same install directories 
as Kahua installed. For example if you gave --prefix=$HOME to 
configure script of Kahua when you installed it, you have to give the 
same option to kahua-web's configure script.

  % ./configure --prefix=$HOME

And then

  % make
  % make check
  % make install

Then, edit app-servers in the Kahua working directory to add "%%_PROJECT_NAME_%%" entry.

  (%%_PROJECT_NAME_%% :arguments () :run-by-default 0)

If you want to allow non registered user to edit page, 
give 'non-member-edit as a argument.

  (%%_PROJECT_NAME_%% :arguments (non-member-edit) :run-by-default 0)

[Invoke %%_PROJECT_NAME_%% in place]

You can invoke the %%_PROJECT_NAME_%% before doing "make install", using
"%%_PROJECT_NAME_%%-start" script.  This script invoke %%_PROJECT_NAME_%% in the kahua-spvr
with test HTTP direct mode on 8080 port.  You can also use
"%%_PROJECT_NAME_%%-stop" to stop process invoked by "%%_PROJECT_NAME_%%-start"

[Information]

You can find some %%_PROJECT_NAME_%%'s information at the Kahua.org site.
