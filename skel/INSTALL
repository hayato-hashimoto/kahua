%%_PROJECT_NAME_%% : A simple skelton of application for Kahua.

[Requirements]

Gauche-0.8.9 or later
Kahua-1.0.1 or later

[Installation]

  % ./DIST gen
  % ./configure [any options if you need]

You have to give some options to specify the same install directories 
as Kahua installed. For example if you gave --prefix=/usr/local/kahua
to configure script of Kahua when you installed it, you have to give
the same option to kahua-web's configure script.

  % ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/kahua

And if you want to install it into a site bundle, you should give
a option like:

  % ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/kahua --with-site-bundle=$HOME/work/site

Now go ahead:

  % make
  % make check
  % make install

and edit app-servers in the Kahua working directory or the site bundle
to add "%%_PROJECT_NAME_%%" entry.
